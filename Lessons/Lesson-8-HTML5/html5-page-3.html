      <h2>Question</h2>
      <p>
        Without using relative or absolute positioning, what is another way to
        organize elements on a page?
      </p>
      <section>
        <p>
          Another way to organize elements on a page is with the CSS margin
          property.

        Why did you choose the colors and the images you selected?
      </p>
      <section>
        <p>
          I'm not very good at choosing complementary colors, so what I did was
          that I went to a color palette website, known as
          <a href="https://coolors.co/">Coolors</a>, and checked out their
          trending palettes. I wanted to go for a light-colored theme, and given
          how many color palettes there are that fit that theme on the first
          page, it didn't take very long until I found one I really liked. The
          link to that color palette is
          <a
            href="https://coolors.co/palette/ccd5ae-e9edc9-fefae0-faedcd-d4a373"
            >here</a
          >. The reason why I chose my image is because Elden Ring is one of my
          favorite games of all time, and I'm a huge fan of the soulsborne
          series. The game also came out recently, so in a way, I guess I'm kind
          of advertising it!

        Rate your experience learning how to utilize HTML5 and linking it to
        CSS. Did you like this assignment? How could this material be easier to
        digest?
      </p>
      <p>
        I would rate this experience a 5/5. I really like this assignment
        becaused I learned a lot in regards to the various CSS properties that
        would make a website look nice and clean. I think the material enough
        was easier to digest since the sections were split evenly, and that the
        elements were structured enough so that the person could easily make the
        changes to the CSS and navigation menu.
